# ComputerGraphics-TransformationProjection

Given the a set of 3d points, the pairs forming each triangle and the camera position and info,
projects the points to the 2d space of the camera and paints the triangles with the algorithm of the
previous assignment https://github.com/KonstantinosChatziantoniou/ComputerGraphics-TriangleFilling.


The demo.m shows a series of transformations applies to the 3d object and the resulting photograph of it.
Modify `show_figs` and `save_img` to view the desired results.

With `show_figs` true, you can see the points in 3d space, the camera position and a vector for the rotation/translation.
